The famous [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)) game created using [FlutterFlow](https://flutterflow.io/). The app is responsive and adapts to both mobile and desktop screen sizes.

## New: AI Mode

You can now use **AI-based Spymasters** while playing Codewords. That means Codewords is now fun even with less people, as low as just 2 players (one Operative in each team).

> AI Spymasters are powered by [GPT 4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).
